# ST_upland_rice
Scripts used for spatial transcriptomics of upland rice

The original expression matrix was used for following analysis.

1.The modified gff file was generated using gtf.generaator in gff_edit/

2.Data integration was performed using merge.sh

3.The marker genes were found by cal_marker.R

4.The RNA velocity analysis was performed using first_4.sh and analysis2.py in velocity/

5.The root development-related genes were obtained by using scripts in monocle3/

6.The exhibition of hormone related genes were generated using known_marker.R
